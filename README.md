                <h3 class="p-heading">Jerry Fabin's bathroom</h3>
                <p>Jerry is still in the shower, scrubbing away. He finally
                turns it off and steps out, a drowned rat. He dries
                himself, wipes the mirror and squints nervously at his
                reflection. Tiny bugs hop around on his head. He screams.</p>

                <h3 class="p-heading">Jerry Fabin's living room</h3>
                <p>Jerry lies on the cruddy shag carpet, open volumes of the
                Encyclopedia Brittanica spread around him. He scratches
                himself as he studies one of the volumes. Insects hop up and
                down all over his body, and on the rug. When he exhales, a
                cloud of bugs pours from his mouth; he shoos them away.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="p-heading"> Jerry Fabin's house</h3>
                <p>Jerry heads up the walkway carrying a shopping bag. Several
                cans of Raid and other bug sprays poke out of the bag. Bugs
                hop around on Jerry. He puts the bag down on the stoop to
                scratch himself. He notices tiny bugs chewing the shrub.</p>
